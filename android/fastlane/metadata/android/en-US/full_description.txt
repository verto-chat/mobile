Meet Verto.chat — the AI-powered messenger that lets people talk in their own language and be understood. Press and hold to speak, get instant transcription and translation, and (only when you want it) text-to-speech playback. Works nearby on one phone or remotely in 1:1 and group chats.

Why Verto.chat
• Talk naturally: hold the mic, speak, release — your message appears with translation
• See both sides: translation shows by default; tap to reveal the original
• Play on demand: generate TTS only when you tap ▶ to save data and battery
• Three modes: Local (one phone, take turns), Direct (1:1), Group (multi-user)
• Multiple languages per chat with a clear default language
• Clean, accessible UI with large touch targets and dark mode by default

How it works

1. Speech-to-text (ASR) turns voice into text
2. AI translation rewrites it for the other language
3. Optional TTS plays a natural voice when you tap ▶
