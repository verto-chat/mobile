Meet Verto.chat — the AI-powered messenger that lets people talk in their own language and be understood. Press and hold to speak, get instant transcription and translation, and (only when you want it) text-to-speech playback. It works nearby on a single phone (Local) or remotely in 1:1 and Group chats.


Why Verto.chat
• Talk naturally: hold the mic, speak, release — your message appears with translation.
• See both sides: translation shows by default; tap to reveal the original text.
• Play on demand: generate TTS only when you tap ▶ to save data, battery, and credits.
• Three modes: Local (one phone, take turns), Direct (1:1), Group (multi-user).
• Multiple languages per chat with a clear default language.
• Clean, accessible UI with large touch targets and dark mode by default.

How it works

1. Speech-to-text converts your voice into text.
